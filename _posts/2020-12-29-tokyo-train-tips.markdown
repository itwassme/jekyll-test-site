When you first arrive in Tokyo it won’t be long before you need to use the subway.  It’s the most efficient way to get to from A to B in super quick time; you just have to master the lines and how they interact first. It’s a major feat of engineering and makes daily life flow for millions of people in Tokyo but it can be a bit overwhelming when you first encounter it.  You’re not going to be able to avoid it for long though so you might as well jump right in.  Here are my five tips to keep you sane and get you to your destination on the Tokyo Subway. 

Known as the Tōkyō chikatetsu, in English it can be translated and referred to as the Tokyo Metro, subway or even the Tokyo Underground depending on who you are talking to but hotel conceirge desks and locals we spoke to generally referred to it as the subway so we mostly stuck with that to avoid confusion.

### Stored value & discount cards

Unless you’re only in the country for a day or two you’ll really benefit from grabbing a stored value card.  It’ll make getting on and off the trains so much quicker than using the  ticket machines all the time.  You can buy a PASMO card from a machine or the station office and then just top it up when you need to.  If you already have another Japanese transport card like the Suica or ICOCA they will work fine too.  You can now use the cards interchangably across the Japanese Subway in various cities and many other forms of public transport.
